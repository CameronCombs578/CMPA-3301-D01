# Cameron Combs

## Introduction:
My name is Cameron Combs. I am a second-year college student taking the **Early Fall 2025 TTU Online Fundamentals of Computing Applications** course. below are my goals, concerns, and other thoughts I have on where the class will take me.

## Course Goals:
1. I hope to understand the advance mechanics of **Markdown** throuhgout this course.
2. During this course, I want to be able to learn how to use my various experiences and skills to become a better technalogical critical thinker.
3. I want to become more farmiliar using **GitHub** to store and edit projects from this class.
4. Improve my knowlegde and skills using the basic functions of **Markdown** such as inserting _links_ and _images_, creating _headers_, and listing words and phrases. 
5. Plan to increase my knowlegde on the basics of business strategies from this course.
6. Will practice my communication skills during the discussion assingments in this cource.

## Potential Challenges:
- A potential challenge that I may face in the future of this course is technical issues using **Markdown** to complete assingments.
- I am concerned about my minimal experiance using **GitHub**. Since this course involves using **GitHub's** capabilities, question on were to navigate may arise.
- I may find difficulties using my other skills and experiances to better complete my tasks for this class.

## Ways to Face Potential Challenges:
- To face my first potential challenge, I plan to practise and use the **Markdown** tutorial from the course as a reference. These steps will help me to more easily complete assingments in this course that require this skill and decrease the number of errors I may encounter.
- I plan to spend time to using **GitHub's** mechanics throughout the class so that I will I can be more experianced with navigating across the website. This will be helpul for my future assignments.
- During the class, I will strive to identify any connections between my skills and my assignments through the many ideas shared in the discussions for this course.

## Conclusion:
A number of my assignments will be managed on **GitHub**. Here is my [**GitHub** profile.](https://github.com/CameronCombs578)  
I am excited to see what new skills I will be able to develop because of this class.
