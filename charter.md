# Cameron Combs

## Introduction:
My name is Cameron Combs. I am a second-year college student taking the **Early Fall 2025 TTU Online Fundamentals of Computing Applications** course. Below are my goals, concerns, and other thoughts about where the class will take me.

## Course Goals:
1. I hope to understand the advanced mechanics of **Markdown** throughout this course.
2. During this course, I want to learn how to use my various experiences and skills to become a better technological critical thinker.
3. I want to become more familiar with using **GitHub** to store and edit projects from this class.
4. Improve my knowledge and skills in using the basic functions of **Markdown** such as inserting _links_ and _images_, creating _headers_, and listing words and phrases.
5. I plan to increase my knowledge of the basics of business strategies from this course.
6. **I** will practice my communication skills during the discussion assignments in this course.

## Potential Challenges:
- A potential challenge that I may face in the future of this course is technical issues when using **Markdown** to complete assignments.
- I am concerned about my minimal experience using **GitHub**. Since this course involves using **GitHub's** capabilities, questions on where to navigate may arise.
- I may find difficulties using my other skills and **experiences** to better complete my tasks for this class.

## Ways to Face Potential Challenges:
- To face my first potential challenge, I plan to practice and use the **Markdown** tutorial from the course as a reference. These steps will help me more easily complete assignments in this course that require this skill and decrease the number of errors I may encounter.
- I plan to spend time using **GitHub's** mechanics throughout the class so that I can be more experienced with navigating the website. This will be helpful for my future assignments.
- During the class, I will strive to identify any connections between my skills and my assignments through the many ideas shared in the discussions for this course.

## Conclusion:
A number of my assignments will be managed on **GitHub**. Here is my [**GitHub** profile.](https://github.com/CameronCombs578)  
I am excited to see what new skills I will be able to develop in this class.
