## Introduction:

I am a second-year college student taking the **Early Fall 2025 TTU Online Fundamentals of Computing Applications** course. below are my goals, concerns, and other thought on where the class will take me.

## Course Goals:
1. I hope to understand the advance mechanics of **Markdown** throuhgout this course.
2. During this course, I want to be able to learn how to use my various experiences and skills to become a better technalogical critical thinker.
3. I want to become more farmiliar using GitHub to store and edit projects from this class.
4. Improve my knowlegde and skills using the basic functions of **Markdown** such as inserting _links_ and _images_, creating headers, and listing words and phrases. 
5. Plan to increase my knowlegde on the basics of business strategies from this course.
6. Will practice my communication skills from the discussion assingments in this cource.

## Potential Challenges:
- A potential challenge that I may face in the future of this course is technical issues using Markdown to complete assingments.
- I am concerned about my minimal experiance using GitHub. Since this course involves using GitHub's capabilities, question on were to navigate may arise.

## Ways to Face Potential Challenges:

- To face my first potential challenge, I plan to use the tutorial as a reference and continuosly practice my skills using **Markdown**. These steps will help me to more easily complete assingments in this course that require this skill and decrease the number of errors I may encounter.

## Conclusion:
A number of my assignments will be managed on GitHub. Here is my [GitHub profile](https://github.com/CameronCombs578)
